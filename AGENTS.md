- Before making any code changes, run `npm run check` to execute the unit tests.
- After making code changes, run `npm run check` again to ensure the unit tests pass.
- If you changed or added features, run the BDD tests (`npm test`) once after your modifications.
- If tests fail, update the code or tests so that they pass before committing.
- Each new or modified feature must include a new BDD style test or an update to an existing one.
