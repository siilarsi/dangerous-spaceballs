- Before making any code changes, run `npm test`.
- After making code changes, run `npm test` again to ensure both the gherkin scenarios and the check_orb_radius test pass.
- If tests fail, update the code or tests so that they pass before committing.
- Each new or modified feature must include a new BDD style test or an update to an existing one.
